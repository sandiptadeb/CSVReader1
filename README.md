# CSVApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.3.
Since it is built in Angular 8 , We have another argument in @ViewChild which is { static : false }

Also, Here NgxPaginationModule has been used to facilitate pagination in order to render a huge file.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Since its in zipped form, after unzipping please run npm install before ng serve --open command.
